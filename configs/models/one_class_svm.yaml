# One-Class SVM Model Configuration
# Boundary-based anomaly detection using Support Vector Machines
# Learns a decision boundary around normal data

model_name: ims_ocsvm
model_type: one_class_svm
dataset_config: configs/ims.yaml

hyperparameters:
  # Kernel type
  # Options: linear, poly, rbf, sigmoid
  # rbf (Radial Basis Function) is most common for anomaly detection
  kernel: rbf

  # Upper bound on the fraction of training errors and lower bound on support vectors
  # Should be approximately equal to contamination
  # Range: (0, 1], typically 0.01 to 0.2
  # Increased to 0.3 for more sensitivity
  nu: 0.3

  # Kernel coefficient for rbf, poly, sigmoid
  # Options: scale (1 / (n_features * X.var())), auto (1 / n_features), or float
  gamma: scale

  # Degree of the polynomial kernel (ignored by other kernels)
  degree: 3

  # Independent term in kernel function (for poly and sigmoid)
  coef0: 0.0

  # Tolerance for stopping criterion
  tol: 0.001

  # Whether to use shrinking heuristic
  shrinking: true

  # Cache size in MB
  cache_size: 200

  # Maximum number of iterations (-1 for no limit)
  max_iter: -1

# Feature scaling method
# Standard or minmax scaling strongly recommended for SVM
scaler: standard

# Features to use for training
features: all

# Random seed for reproducibility
random_state: 42

# Output paths
paths:
  model_output: artifacts/models/ims_ocsvm.joblib
  scaler_output: artifacts/models/ims_ocsvm_scaler.joblib
  report_dir: artifacts/reports/ims_ocsvm/
