# Isolation Forest Model Configuration
# Fast, works well for high-dimensional data
# Uses ensemble of isolation trees to detect anomalies

model_name: fd002_iforest
model_type: isolation_forest
dataset_config: configs/fd002.yaml

hyperparameters:
  # Number of trees in the forest
  n_estimators: 100

  # Expected proportion of anomalies in the dataset
  # Used for decision threshold (not for training)
  contamination: 0.1

  # Number of features to draw from X to train each base estimator
  # 1.0 = use all features
  max_features: 1.0

  # If True, individual trees are fit on random subsets with replacement
  bootstrap: false

  # Controls tree depth (default: average path length)
  max_samples: auto

# Feature scaling method
# Options: standard (zero mean, unit variance), minmax (0-1), robust (median-based), none
scaler: standard

# Features to use for training
# Options: 'all' or list of feature names
# If 'all', uses all numeric features from the dataset
features: all

# Random seed for reproducibility
random_state: 42
