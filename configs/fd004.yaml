# Data preparation settings - how to clean and transform the data
prep:
  # Remove rows with missing values (false = keep them, impute instead)
  # CMAPSS data may have missing values, so we impute rather than drop
  drop_na: false
  
  # How to fill in missing values (median = use median value of that column)
  # Median is more robust to outliers than mean for sensor data
  impute: median
  
  # How to normalize/scale numeric features (standard = mean 0, standard deviation 1)
  # This helps the model train better by putting all features on the same scale
  # StandardScaler is only fitted on training data, then applied to val/test
  scale: standard
  
  # Whether to create time windows for sequential data (true = use windows, false = don't)
  # CMAPSS is time-series data, so we MUST use windows to create sequences
  use_windowing: true
  
  # Window settings for time-series data
  window_params:
    # Size of each window in cycles (number of time steps per window)
    # Window size of 30 cycles provides good temporal context
    window_size: 30
    # Step size between windows (stride = 10 means less overlap, faster processing)
    # step_size: 10 = each window overlaps by 20 cycles
    step_size: 10
    # Whether to label windows with RUL at end of window (true) or start (false)
    # label_at_end: true = RUL value at the last cycle of the window
    label_at_end: true
    # Maximum RUL value (cap) to prevent very long RUL from dominating training
    # Engines with RUL > cap_value are treated as having RUL = cap_value
    cap_rul: 125
  
  # RUL derivation settings
  derive_rul:
    # Whether to cap RUL values (true = use cap_value as maximum)
    # Capping prevents early-cycle engines (very high RUL) from dominating training
    use_cap: true
    # Maximum RUL value to use (cycles with RUL > this become cap_value)
    # Common values: 100, 125, 130 (125 is a common choice)
    cap_value: 125

# Data splitting - how to divide the dataset for training and testing
split:
  # Method to split the data: by_unit_holdout = split by entire engines
  # This prevents data leakage where training and test data come from the same engine
  # All cycles from a given engine unit go to the same split
  method: by_unit_holdout
  
  # Percentage/ratio of engine units to use for validation (10% = 0.1)
  # Remaining engines go to training
  val_units_ratio: 0.1
  
  # Random seed to ensure reproducible splits (same seed = same split every time)
  # Set to 42 for consistency - change to any number if you want a different split
  random_state: 42
  
  # Group by engine unit to ensure all cycles from same engine stay together
  group_by: unit

# File format - how to parse the data files
file_format:
  # Delimiter for separating values (whitespace - spaces or tabs)
  # CMAPSS files are space-separated
  delimiter: "\\s+"
  # Whether files have headers (false = no headers, just data)
  header: false
  # Columns in order as they appear in the file (26 columns total)
