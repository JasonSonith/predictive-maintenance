● Here's what to do:

  Step-by-step Colab setup:

  1. Create new Colab notebook

  - Go to https://colab.research.google.com
  - File → New notebook

  2. Mount Google Drive and setup

  Paste this into the first cell and run:

  # Mount Google Drive
  from google.colab import drive
  drive.mount('/content/drive')

  # Navigate to your Drive
  %cd /content/drive/MyDrive

  # List files to find your zip
  !ls

  3. Unzip your project

  # Unzip (adjust the filename to match yours)
  !unzip -q predictive-maintenance.zip

  # Navigate into the project
  %cd predictive-maintenance

  # Verify structure
  !ls -la

  4. Install dependencies

  # Install requirements
  !pip install -r requirements.txt

  5. Run training

  # Train Isolation Forest
  !python scripts/train.py --config configs/models/isolation_forest.yaml

  # Or train other models
  # !python scripts/train.py --config configs/models/knn_lof.yaml
  # !python scripts/train.py --config configs/models/one_class_svm.yaml

  6. Check results

  # View trained models
  !ls -lh artifacts/models/

  # View run metadata
  !cat artifacts/reports/ims_iforest/run.json

  7. Download models back to your computer

  # Zip the artifacts for download
  !zip -r trained_models.zip artifacts/

  # Then right-click on trained_models.zip in the file browser (left panel)
  # and click "Download"

  Quick all-in-one cell:

  If you want to run everything at once:

  from google.colab import drive
  drive.mount('/content/drive')

  %cd /content/drive/MyDrive
  !unzip -q predictive-maintenance.zip
  %cd predictive-maintenance

  !pip install -q -r requirements.txt

  # Train all three models
  !python scripts/train.py --config configs/models/isolation_forest.yaml
  !python scripts/train.py --config configs/models/knn_lof.yaml
  !python scripts/train.py --config configs/models/one_class_svm.yaml

  # Package results
  !zip -r trained_models.zip artifacts/
  print("\n✅ Done! Download trained_models.zip from the file browser")

  Note: If your zip file is large (>100MB with the feature data), the unzip step might
  take a minute. The actual training should still be fast (~1-5 seconds per model).
